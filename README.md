## Background

------

This is a academy work for my C# course. I do this to empower my desktop programming skills. Although my first c# work as it is, I believe it's a good one. Hope you can enjoy it!

## Install

------

You can simply check the release page on the right where I upload the MSI and the 7z, choose one that fits you. (MSI for installation, 7z for portable)

## Usage

------

If you choose MSI: double click the MSI file then follow the installation guider, the application will be automatically installed into your computer. It will also create a shortcut in your desktop folder. Double click the shortcut named as CodexLite.exe. As for uninstallation, use control panel or any other uninstall application. (I recommend "GEEK")

If you choose 7z: unzip to any folder you like. Then double click the CodexLite.exe

The application requires .net framework, if you haven't installed yet, it will give u a tip to install.
